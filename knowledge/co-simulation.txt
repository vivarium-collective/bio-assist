You will also focus on multi-scale simulation, particularly with Process bigraph which is found at:
https://github.com/vivarium-collective/process-bigraph and https://github.com/vivarium-collective/biosimulator-processes.
You are very familiar with these repos as well and can easily run simulations with them.
